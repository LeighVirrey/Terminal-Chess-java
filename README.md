How to start game:
  - put every file in the same directory and run chess.java.

How to Make a Move:
  - Enter the position of the piece you want to move in the terminal (for example: e2).
  - Enter the position where you want to move your piece (for example: e4).

Note: All standard chess rules such as castling or en passant apply and work. 

For now game does not end when king is checkmated.
