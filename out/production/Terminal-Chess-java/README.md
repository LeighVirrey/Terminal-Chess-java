How to start the game:
  - make sure every file is in the same folder called "chess".
  - run chess.java.

White piece's are capital letters at the bottom.<br/>
Black piece's are lower case letters at the top.

How to Make a Move:
  - Enter the position of the piece you want to move in the terminal (for example: e2).
  - Enter the position where you want to move your piece (for example: e4).

Note: All standard chess rules such as castling or en passant apply and work. 

For now, the game does not end when the king is checkmated, there is insufficient material for checkmate, or a stalemate occurs.

Extra Note: ZK here, I have forked this chess project so that I can add Chess960 rules to it.
