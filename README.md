How to start game:
  - put every file in the directory "chess" and run chess.java.

White piece's are capital letters at the bottom.
Black piece's are lower case letters at the top.

How to Make a Move:
  - Enter the position of the piece you want to move in the terminal (for example: e2).
  - Enter the position where you want to move your piece (for example: e4).

Note: All standard chess rules such as castling or en passant apply and work. 

For now, the game does not end when the king is checkmated, there is insufficient material for checkmate, or a stalemate occurs.
